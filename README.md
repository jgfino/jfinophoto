# jfinophoto.com Frontend

This repo contains the frontend implementation for my photography website [jfinophoto.com](https://jfinophoto.com). It is built from scratch using create-react-app and custom styling with styled-components. For the backend implementation, see the [backend repo](https://github.com/jgfino/jfinophoto-backend).

Content is automatically updated whenever I upload edits to Google Drive.
